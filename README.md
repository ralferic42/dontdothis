This repository will contain java examples for software that should not have been written. That is not to say they are not working or useless. They all seemed like a good idea at first sight. In retrospect it is just better to do without them. 

For now, i plan to do the examples mentioned below. Each one will have its own readme stating how it works and what to do instead. 
  - Reified Collections: Would you like to have a map that safely stores different types of objects?
  - Immutable Date: java.util.Date is mutable and always carries the risk of unwanted/malicious modification. How about a derivation with all the setters disabled? That should make updating legacy code a breeze...
  - Merge Join: Did you ever sweat over two nested loops comparing two collections? Have you ever missed one of the corner cases? Can't we do this more elegantly, namely as a merge-join?
